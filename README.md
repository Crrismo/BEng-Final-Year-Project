# BEng-Final-Year-Project Oxygen Diamond Sensors for Extreme Environments
This project examines the attributes of diamond technology intending to develop a multifunctional amperometric oxygen sensor suitable for harsh environmental applications. To observe their electrochemical characteristics and performance as working electrodes for an oxygen sensor, three different diamond-samples are analysed and tested. Experiments with chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry were completed to assess the performance of the electrodes. The use of boron-doped diamond (BDD) in electrochemistry has been thoroughly investigated and it demonstrated a wide electrochemical potential, impressive physical and chemical durability. These characteristics make it an ideal option for the first two electrodes: Pt-on-diamond disc microelectrode and 3nm-Pt-NPs on BDD electrode. Alternatively, localised graphitic-like regions were employed for the third electrode.
